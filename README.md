Student DataTable Manager in C#
This project is a fully self-contained C# class that simulates a student data management system using System.Data.DataTable. It showcases fundamental concepts of software engineering such as data validation, separation of concerns, clean interfaces, and efficient data filtering and manipulation — all without using a database or any external packages.

✅ Key Features
In-Memory Data Handling using DataTable with strong typing and constraints

Custom Data Validation for name, age, gender, phone number, and email format

CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with graceful error handling

Search & Filtering by various fields

Data Integrity enforced by primary key and email uniqueness

Statistical Insights like total number of students and average age

Cloning and Change Management using manual row tracking and AcceptChange() mechanism

Designed Without ORMs to demonstrate raw handling of data in memory

Fully Extensible for future enhancements (e.g., file export/import, UI integration)
